// 🚀 React Hook Series: Understanding useMemo — Optimize Your Component Performance!

/**
 When you dealing with large data and expensive computation as a react developer you have to need focus on website performance.One powerful tool React gives us to handle this efficiently is the useMemo hook.
Today, let’s dive into what useMemo is, why it’s useful, and how you can use it to make your components faster and smarter. 
  
 
 
  What is useMemo? 

  UseMemo is a react hooks that's let you catch the result of the expensive calculation between the component re-render.
 
 
 When you have to need use useMemo?
  - When you have to need expensive operation (e.g.filtering, sorting, computing)
  - When you have to need avoid unnecessary recalculation every time your component re-renders

  Syntax : 
  const useMemoValue = useMemo(()=>{ 
    set logic 
    return value
    }, [dependencies])

  How to work useMemo: 
  
 call useMemo at the top of your component for catching the calculate value.
  import { useMemo } from 'react';


   For using useMemo you have to need pass the two argument for use useMemo

   1. First Argument :  Calculation function  that take no argument and return a value that you have to need.
   
   Example : 

   () => {
     return users?.filter((user) => user.toLowerCase().includes(search.toLowerCase()));
   }

   in this example i have search user from a array.

   2. Second Argument :  List of dependencies that use inside your calculation. react re-render your component if any dependencies value is changes.


   Example : 

     const filteredProducts = useMemo(()=>{
       return products.filter(product=>product.name.toLowerCase()?.includes(query.toLowerCase()))
     }, [query]) 

     Here, filteredProducts will only re-calculate when the query changes — not on every keypress or render. That’s the power of memoization.



     Conclusion : 

     React useMemo is the great hook for boosting your website performance. and if you are working on the large scale react project then you have 
     to need focusing on the performance. and useMemo is the boost your website performance.

  🚀 React Hook Series: Understanding useMemo — Optimize Your Component Performance!
When you're working with large datasets or performing expensive computations, performance becomes a critical aspect of your React application.

React provides a powerful hook called useMemo to help skip unnecessary recalculations and make your components more efficient.

In this blog, let’s explore what useMemo is, when to use it, and how it helps optimize your app’s performance.

🔍 What is useMemo?
useMemo is a React Hook that lets you memoize the result of an expensive calculation between component re-renders.


When Should You Use useMemo?
✅ Use useMemo when:

You're performing heavy operations like filtering, sorting, or calculations.

You want to prevent unnecessary recalculations on every render.

You're working with large lists or data sets.

🧾 Syntax

const memoizedValue = useMemo(() => {
  // your logic here
  return value;
}, [dependencies]);

⚙️ How useMemo Works
To use useMemo, follow these two steps:

First Argument : A calculation function that returns the value you want to cache.

Example:

() => {
  return users?.filter(user =>
    user.toLowerCase().includes(search.toLowerCase())
  );
}
In this example, we’re filtering users based on a search term.

Second Argument : A list of dependencies.
React will only re-run the calculation if any of these dependencies change.

Example:

const filteredProducts = useMemo(() => {
  return products.filter(product =>
    product.name.toLowerCase().includes(query.toLowerCase())
  );
}, [query]);
Here, filteredProducts will only re-calculate when query changes not on every render. That’s the power of memoization.

🎯 Conclusion
useMemo is a great performance optimization tool in React. If you're working on a large-scale project, it's important to consider how often your components re-render and how heavy the calculations are.

By using useMemo, you can:

Avoid unnecessary logic execution.

Improve performance.

Make your app smoother and more responsive.
