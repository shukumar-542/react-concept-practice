🔧 Understanding useReducer in React with a Real-World Todo App Example
When managing complex state logic in a React component, useState can become limiting or messy. That's where the useReducer hook shines!

Let’s explore what useReducer is, how it works, and how I used it in one of my projects to build a simple Todo app.

📌 What is useReducer?
useReducer is a React hook that helps you manage complex state logic by separating state updates into a reducer function. It takes two arguments:


const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState);
Let’s break this down:

1. state
This holds the current state value. On the initial render, it’s set to initialState.

2. dispatch
A function you call to update the state. It sends an action to the reducer, which then returns the new state. This triggers a re-render just like setState.

3. reducer
A pure function that takes the current state and an action object, and returns a new state. It defines how the state should change based on the action type.

4. initialState
This is the starting value of your state — it can be a number, object, array, etc.

📝 Real-Life Example: Building a Todo App with useReducer
In one of my projects, I used useReducer to manage a list of todos. It allowed me to keep the state logic clean and organized.

Here’s how I set it up:

✅ Reducer Function

export const todoReducer = (state, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'add_todo':
      return [...state, { id: Date.now(), text: action.payload, complete: false }];
    case 'delete_todo':
      return state.filter((todo) => todo.id !== action.payload);
    default:
      return state;
  }
};
This todoReducer function handles two actions:

add_todo: Adds a new todo item.

delete_todo: Removes a todo based on its id.

Each action has a type and an optional payload (the data needed to perform the update).

📦 Initial State

export const todoInitialState = [];
The state starts as an empty array since we’re storing a list of todos.

🧠 Using useReducer in the Component

const [todoState, todoDispatch] = useReducer(todoReducer, todoInitialState);
➕ Adding a Todo

const handleAdd = () => {
  todoDispatch({ type: 'add_todo', payload: text });
  setText("");
};
❌ Deleting a Todo

const handleDelete = (id) => {
  todoDispatch({ type: 'delete_todo', payload: id });
};


🎯 When to Use useReducer?
Use useReducer when:

State logic is complex and involves multiple sub-values.

Next state depends on the previous one.

You want better structure and separation of concerns in state management.

🚀 Final Thoughts
useReducer makes state management more predictable and maintainable — especially in apps that grow beyond a few state variables.

If you're comfortable with useState, try exploring useReducer next time you build a feature like a form, shopping cart, or todo list. You’ll appreciate how it simplifies complex updates!
